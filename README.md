## DSP Project: Image Frequency Domain Analysis and Denoising ##

### Requirement of project ###

#### 1.Image frequency domain conversion

- Calculate and draw the center frequency spectrum of the image
- Process image in frequency domain with Gaussian low pass filter and Gaussian high pass filter respectively
- Use the frequency domain Laplace operator to sharpen the image

#### 2.Add noise to the image

- Add at least two kinds of noise to the image, such as Gaussian noise, Salt-and-pepper noise, periodic noise, etc., or other noise

#### 3.Image denoising and result analysis

- Gaussian template, spatial domain method of median filtering and frequency filtering method of Fourier transform and wavelet transform are respectively used to de-noising images. Based on PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value and visual effect, the denoising ability of these four denoising methods to different types of noise added before should be compared.
